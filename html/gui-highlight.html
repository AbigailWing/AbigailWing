            <h1>GUI Highlight Videos</h1>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users needed quick, engaging resources to learn GUI functionalities efficiently.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Created a series of video tutorials highlighting core features, which involved the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Script Writing:</strong> I wrote detailed scripts in <strong>Microsoft Word</strong> to outline the content and flow of each tutorial. These scripts were designed to highlight core features, ensuring clarity and conciseness.</li>
                <li><strong>Narration:</strong> Once the scripts were finalized, a team member recorded the narration to guide users through the video.</li>
                <li><strong>Storyboarding:</strong> I created storyboards to visualize the sequence of the video, ensuring that each scene aligned with the script and effectively demonstrated GUI features.</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Feedback:</strong> After drafting the videos, I shared them with stakeholders for feedback, making revisions as needed to meet user expectations and ensure the video accurately addressed their needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Editing:</strong> Using <strong>TechSmith Camtasia</strong>, I edited the videos by adding graphics, transitions, and visual cues to enhance the learning experience. For audio editing, I used <strong>Adobe Audiate</strong> to ensure clear and professional sound quality. Additionally, I incorporated captions to improve accessibility for all users.</li>
                <li><strong>Publishing:</strong> Finally, the updated videos were posted to <strong>YouTube</strong>, making them easily accessible to users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Increased user engagement and reduced time spent on support inquiries.</p>
