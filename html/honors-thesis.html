            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The accessibility of UMass Amherst's financial aid websites needed to be tested to ensure that students with disabilities could effectively use the sites. There was limited research on how users with disabilities interact with these sites.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Over the course of a year, I led a comprehensive usability study that involved recruiting six students with disabilities to test the financial aid websites. The process included the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recruitment:</strong> I recruited six students with various disabilities to participate in the usability study, ensuring a diverse range of perspectives.</li>
                <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> I created specific tasks for usability testing, focusing on the key features and navigation of the financial aid websites to evaluate how accessible they were for users with disabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Qualitative Data Collection:</strong> I conducted qualitative usability testing, gathering feedback from participants about their experiences, challenges, and areas for improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>Personas Creation:</strong> Based on the findings from the testing, I created personas in <strong>Figma</strong> to represent the diverse user needs and experiences encountered during the study.</li>
                <li><strong>Usability Report:</strong> After analyzing the data, I compiled a detailed usability report in <strong>Microsoft Word</strong>, which was 32 pages long, outlining my findings and providing recommendations for improving accessibility on the websites.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The research provided valuable insights into the accessibility of the financial aid websites. The findings were shared with UMass Amherst to inform future improvements, ensuring a more inclusive and accessible experience for students with disabilities. The study helped increase awareness of accessibility issues and contributed to making the websites more user-friendly for a broader audience.</p>
