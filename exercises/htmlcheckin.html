        <h1> Three Ways of Overcoming Writer's Block </h1>
        <hr>

        <h2> 1. Take a Break </h2>
        <p> Oftentimes, when we encounter writer's block, our first instinct is to power through, even if no new ideas come to us. We think that as long as we 
            keep trying, eventually we will come up with a new idea. However, it usually helps to take a short break so that we can refocus with an open mind.
        </p> <br>

        <h2> 2. Try the Pomodoro Technique </h2>
        <p> The Pomodoro technique is a time management strategy that can help you to significantly improve your productivity. It works like this: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Set aside time in your day to write </li>
            <li> Set a timer for 25 minutes </li>
            <li> Write for 25 minutes with no distractions </li>
            <li> Take a 5 minute break before repeating the process </li>
            <li> Repeat the above steps for as long as it takes to complete the writing task you seek to accomplish </li>
        </ol>

        <h2> 3. Do Some Free Writing </h2>
        <p> A blank page can be intimidating to even the most seasoned writer. One way of pushing past the blank page barrier is to set aside 30 minutes to write down
            whatever comes to mind. Afterward, you can look through what you wrote and decide what you want to keep. Some of the benefits of this technique include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Improving your writing skills </li>
            <li> Building confidence in your writing abilities </li>
            <li> Forming a writing habit </li>
            <li> Allowing yourself to write without self-censoring </li>
        </ul>
