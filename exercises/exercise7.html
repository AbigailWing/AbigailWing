        <p> <a class="button" href= "../pdfs/word_manual_for_writing_center_tutors.pdf"> Microsoft Word 2019 for Writing Tutors Manual (PDF) </a> <br>
        I wrote this 26-page manual on Microsoft Word 2019 for Writing Tutors as a semester-long project for a technical writing class. I created this manual for tutors to 
        use when collaborating with tutees in the UMass Amherst writing center. It covers topics such as sharing a Word document, tracking changes, fixing spelling and grammar errors, and 
        inserting citations.

        <p> <a class="button" href= "../pdfs/plant_based_food_pantry_grant_proposal.pdf"> Fresco y Sano: Reducing Food Insecurity in Lawrence, MA Grant Proposal (PDF) </a> <br>
        I created this 22-page grant proposal on establishing a plant-based mobile food pantry in Lawrence, MA as a semester-long project for a professional writing class. 
        This grant proposal sought $131,000 from the Food Security Infrastruction Grant Program (FSIG) to fund general infrastructure costs as well as staff wages.

        <p> <a class="button" href= "../pdfs/representations_of_climate_refugees_final.pdf"> Representations of Climate Refugees Final Paper (PDF) </a> <br>
        I collaborated with my group members to produce an 8-page paper on representations of climate refugees for a junior year writing English class. This paper explores how neoliberal language prevents
        audiences from empathetically engaging with the issue of climate refugees.

        <p> <a class="button" href= "../pdfs/the_first_amendment_and_hate_speech_final.pdf"> The First Amendment and Hate Speech Final Paper (PDF) </a> <br>
        I wrote this 11-page paper on the First Amendment and hate speech for a junior year writing history class. This paper explores different thinkers' views 
        concerning free speech and hate speech to come to a better understanding of how to contend with hate speech in a modern context.
